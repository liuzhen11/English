   c. 1300, "to make (someone) an heir" (a sense now obsolete), from Old French enheriter "make heir, attribute the right of inheretance to, appoint as heir," from Late Latin inhereditare "to appoint as heir," from in- "in" (from PIE root [*en](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*en?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "in") + Latin hereditare "to inherit," from heres (genitive heredis) "heir" (see [heredity](https://www.etymonline.com/word/heredity?ref=etymonline_crossreference)).

Abyss  noun [ C usually singular ] UK   /əˈbɪs/ US   /əˈbɪs/

1. 助记.

   a(没有)+byssos（底部）看不到底的深渊，引申为困境

2. 词源.

   OED

   Late Middle English (in the sense ‘infernal pit’): via late Latin from Greek abussos ‘bottomless’, from a- ‘without’ + bussos ‘depth’.

   ETYMON.

   late 14c. in Latin form abyssus, "depths of the earth or sea; primordial chaos;" early 14c. as abime "depths of the earth or sea; bottomless pit, Hell" (from Old French; see [abysm](https://www.etymonline.com/word/abysm?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). Both are from Late Latin abyssus "bottomless pit," from Greek abyssos (limne) "bottomless (pool)," from abyssos "bottomless, unfathomed," hence, generally, "enormous, unfathomable," also as a noun, he abyssos "the great depth, the underworld, the bottomless pit." This is a compound of a- "without" (see [a-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/a-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (3)) + byssos "bottom," a word of uncertain origin possibly related to bathos "depth" [Liddell & Scott]. Watkins suggests a connection with the root of bottom (n.); Beekes suggests it is pre-Greek.

   The current form in English is a 16c. partial re-Latinization. Greek abyssos was used in Septuagint to translate Hebrew tehom "original chaos" and was used in the New Testament for "Hell." OED notes, "the word has had five variants, abime, abysm, abysmus, abyssus, abyss; of which abyss remains as the ordinary form, and abysm as archaic or poetic." In reference to a seemingly bottomless gulf from 1630s.

   2.困境；险境；绝境a difficult situation that brings trouble or destruction



**​Threshold** UK   /ˈθreʃ.həʊld/ US   /ˈθreʃ.hoʊld/

1. 助记,

   门槛引申为起点，界限

2. 词源.

   **OED Origin**

   Old English therscold, threscold; related to German dialect Drischaufel; the first element is related to thresh (in a Germanic sense ‘tread’), but the origin of the second element is unknown.

   **Etymology**

   Old English þrescold, þærscwold, þerxold, etc., "door-sill, point of entering," of uncertain origin and probably much altered by folk-etymology. The first element probably is related to Old English þrescan (see thresh), either in its current sense of "thresh" or with its original sense of "tread, trample." Second element has been much transformed in all the Germanic languages, suggesting its literal sense was lost even in ancient times. In English it probably has been altered to conform to hold. Liberman (Oxford University Press blog, Feb. 11, 2015) revives an old theory that the second element is the Proto-Germanic instrumental suffix *-thlo and the original sense of threshold was a threshing area adjacent to the living area of a house. Cognates include Old Norse þreskjoldr, Swedish tröskel, Old High German driscufli, German dialectal drischaufel. Figurative use was in Old English.

3. 释义.

1. 助记.em（in）+brace（arms）在胳膊里，就是拥抱了

2. 词源.

   **OED Origin**

   Middle English (in the sense ‘encircle, surround, enclose’; formerly also as imbrace): from Old French embracer, based on Latin in- ‘in’ + bracchium ‘arm’.

   **Etymology**

   mid-14c., "clasp in the arms," from Old French embracier (12c., Modern French embrasser) "clasp in the arms, enclose; covet, handle, cope with," from assimilated form of en- "in" (see [en-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/en-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (1)) + brace, braz "the arms," from Latin bracchium (neuter plural brachia) "an arm, a forearm," from Greek brakhion "an arm" (see [brachio-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/brachio-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)).
