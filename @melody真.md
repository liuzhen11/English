**Casino**
这是中文里蹦出的单词。相传是马可波罗发明的，当年马可波罗在他的马可波罗行纪里面描写元大都的那种盛况的时候，那时候人们喜欢玩一种游戏，那种游戏就是把一个骰子放在碗里面开始摇，开盖的那一瞬间他们就会说“开骰”了，马可波罗听到这个音觉得像casino，于是就把赌博的游戏就演变成了今天的赌场。

Introduction

blizzard n.

释义:

1. a severe snow storm with strong winds暴风雪；雪暴
2. a large amount of something that arrives or is produced together in aconfusing or badly organized way大量繁乱的事（物）

词源:

1.选自牛津词典词源

Early 19th century (originally US, denoting a violent blow): of unknown origin.

2.选自etymonline

"strong, sustained storm of wind and cold, and dry, driving snow," 1859, origin obscure (perhaps somehow connected with [blaze](https://www.etymonline.com/word/blaze?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (n.1), and compare [blazer](https://www.etymonline.com/word/blazer?ref=etymonline_crossreference)); it came into general use in the U.S. in this sense in the hard winter of 1880-81. OED says it probably is "more or less onomatopœic," and adds "there is nothing to indicate a French origin." Before that it typically meant "a violent blow," also "hail of gunfire" in American English from 1829, and blizz "violent rainstorm" is attested from 1770. The winter storm sense perhaps is originally a colloquial figurative use in the Upper Midwest of the U.S.

词源:

1.选自牛津词源词典

Late Middle English (in the sense ‘infernal pit’): via late Latin from Greek abussos ‘bottomless’, from a- ‘without’ + bussos ‘depth’.

2.选自etymonline

late 14c. in Latin form abyssus, "depths of the earth or sea; primordial chaos;" early 14c. as abime "depths of the earth or sea; bottomless pit, Hell" (from Old French; see [abysm](https://www.etymonline.com/word/abysm?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). Both are from Late Latin abyssus "bottomless pit," from Greek abyssos (limne) "bottomless (pool)," from abyssos "bottomless, unfathomed," hence, generally, "enormous, unfathomable," also as a noun, he abyssos "the great depth, the underworld, the bottomless pit." This is a compound of a- "without" (see [a-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/a-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (3)) + byssos "bottom," a word of uncertain origin possibly related to bathos "depth" [Liddell & Scott]. Watkins suggests a connection with the root of bottom (n.); Beekes suggests it is pre-Greek.

The current form in English is a 16c. partial re-Latinization. Greek abyssos was used in Septuagint to translate Hebrew tehom "original chaos" and was used in the New Testament for "Hell." OED notes, "the word has had five variants, abime, abysm, abysmus, abyssus, abyss; of which abyss remains as the ordinary form, and abysm as archaic or poetic." In reference to a seemingly bottomless gulf from 1630s.

Old English þrescold, þærscwold, þerxold, etc., "door-sill, point of entering," of uncertain origin and probably much altered by folk-etymology. The first element probably is related to Old English þrescan (see [thresh](https://www.etymonline.com/word/thresh?ref=etymonline_crossreference)), either in its current sense of "thresh" or with its original sense of "tread, trample." Second element has been much transformed in all the Germanic languages, suggesting its literal sense was lost even in ancient times. In English it probably has been altered to conform to [hold](https://www.etymonline.com/word/hold?ref=etymonline_crossreference). Liberman (Oxford University Press blog, Feb. 11, 2015) revives an old theory that the second element is the Proto-Germanic instrumental suffix *-thlo and the original sense of threshold was a threshing area adjacent to the living area of a house. Cognates include Old Norse þreskjoldr, Swedish tröskel, Old High German driscufli, German dialectal drischaufel. Figurative use was in Old English.
